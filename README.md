##Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input
on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin
page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
##Student Tracker
This is a data visualization application that is meant to store and display basic stats about
purposes of students (name and age). It is an MVC web application that utilizes Entity Framework 6 for
data access and a Code First workflow. It is still a work in progress.
