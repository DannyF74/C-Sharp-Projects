# C-Sharp-Projects
Here are some of the C# projects I've worked on during my time at The Tech Academy.

## Projects:
* [Blackjack Game](https://github.com/DannyF74/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Twenty-One)
* [Car Insurance](https://github.com/DannyF74/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)
* [Student Tracker](https://github.com/DannyF74/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CodeFirst)


### Blackjack Game
This is a C# console application of the card game Blackjack. This apllication
creates multiple objects like cards, decks, players and dealers then runs through
the logic that handles the rules of the game. 

### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input
on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin
page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### Student Tracker
This is a data visualization application that is meant to store and display basic stats about
purposes of students (name and age). It is an MVC web application that utilizes Entity Framework 6 for
data access and a Code First workflow. It is still a work in progress.
